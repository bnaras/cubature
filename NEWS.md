- Replace `src/Cuba-4.2-win/common/Random.c:105` with equivalent to ensure gcc 8.x erroneous warning is avoided on Windows
- Add `rmarkdown` to suggests in description

# cubature 2.0.4.1

- Pass `$(AR)`, `$(ARFLAGS)`, `$(RANLIB)` to `make` so that LTO checks
  pick up correct plugins. Also add `cleanup` script.  (Thanks,
  Prof. Brian Ripley)

# cubature 2.0.4

- `cubintegrate` now matches method via `match.arg` ([Issue
  25](https://github.com/bnaras/cubature/issues/25))

- Address `gcc` version 10.0 changes due to `-fno-common` default
  setting.

# cubature 2.0.3

- Fixed up stack overrun in `Cuba-4.2/src/divonne/Split.c` (lines
  119--128 utilizing a flag for first time through loop
- More cleanup of `Makevars`

# cubature 2.0.2

- Fixed up uninitialized count for `hcubature` (Thanks, Ehsan
  Masoudi)
- Tentative fix of infinite value for `minfluct` in
  `Cuba-4.2/src/suave/Integrate.c` in lines 197--205. (Thanks,
  Prof. Brian Ripley) 
- Miscellaneous fixes for compilation on various platforms.
  * Cleaned up `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` to remove some unused
    flags. Tentative fix for solaris in `Makevars` and
    `Cuba-4.2/src/common/stddecl.c`.
  * Removed printing of `statefile` in all the `src/*/Integrate.c`
    routines to avoid segfault on solaris.
  * Added `ret_code` for return value in call to `getloadavg` in
    `Cuba-4.2/src/common/Fork.c`. Also added an `#ifdef SOLARIS` for
    including appropriate header under solaris.
  * Fixed up call to `MASTER` variadic macro by including dummy argument
    0 in `Cuba-4.2/src/common/Fork.c`, line 146.
  * Replaced multi-statement macro with a `do { } while(0)` hack.
  * Reworked code around `Cuba-4.2/src/divonne/Rule.c` checks for
    key values (lines 593 to 600).
  * Fixed up call to `WORKER` variadic macro by including dummy argument
    0 in `Cuba-4.2/src/common/Parallel.c`, line 393.
  * Moved `#ifdef FRAMECOPY` outside in
    `Cuba-4.2/src/common/Parallel.c` to avoid embedding directives in
    macro args, lines 70-80.

  vignette with information on imminent 2.0 release.

  hitting the CRAN size limit.

# cubature 1.3-2

- Added vignette showing huge gains due to vectorization

# cubature 1.3-1

- Added vector versions

# cubature 1.3-0

- Moved to `Rcpp` framework
- Added tests in preparation for SGJ cubature-1.0.2 version

# cubature 1.1-3

- Roxygenized in preparation for upgrade to newer version of
  cubature library on abinitio website

  `adapt_integrate_v` so that they are directly callable from C

# cubature 1.1-2

- Fixed typo in doc for function `adaptIntegrate`; default value for
  `doChecking` was incorrectly stated as `TRUE`

# cubature 1.1-1

  computation time in evaluating integrand (9% speedup).

# cubature 1.1

  website](https://github.com/stevengj/cubature)
